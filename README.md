# Introduction
This project is an effort to construct a semantic analyzer.
The semantic analyzer provides appropriate checking for errors not included in the grammar, but defined by the
language.

# Semantic Analysis Caveats
The semantic analysis treats function identifiers the same as variable identifiers, as such a variable cannot take
on the name of a function, or vice versa.

# Invoking the application
Invoke the application by calling:
    ./p3 filename

    where filename is the path to the C- program to parse.

# Main
The entry point to the application is main.py.

# Lexical Analyzer Program Flow
The input file is processed line by line, character by character. At the beginning of a new token, the analyzer
determines the type (or set of types) the new token may belong to.

The analyzer then accepts characters until a character is found which does not comply with the determined
token type, handling errors as necessary.

The output result is a listing of tokens as they are recognized. A token collection is ready to be passed
to a language parser.

Nested comments and Floating point numbers are supported.

# Parser Program Flow
The tokens generated by the lexical analysis are passed to the parser. The recursive descent parser begins analyzing
the token stack for correctness in regards to the grammar.

# Semantic Analyzer Program Flow
As the parser analyzes the token stack, a symbol table is generated. The symbol table is used to validate the
token stack against semantic rules of the C- language.

# Output Files
This program produces output to the console.

In the semantics state, the program simply outputs "ACCEPT" or "REJECT" (with no newlines) depending on
if the input is parsable by the grammar and semantically valid.

An example of semantic analysis output is saved to the output directory.
